# Interacive map for NIKKE Goddess of Victory.

Any questions on how the map works or want to send me higher quality pictures for the maps? Contact me in Discord (sefhi)

## Link to embed on your site -> https://nikke-map.onrender.com/

I made it open source and hosted on render.com so anyone can embed it on their own websites.

If you attribute it's cool ([Loot & Waifus](https://www.youtube.com/@lootandwaifus)) but it's not required.

By the community for the community.

To run the project locally just clone and open index.html, simple project using leaflet.js for the map.

*If you are in development mode and want to add new markers*, there's a function in line 86 or so to add markers on mouse click.

Just make sure to comment it before doing a pull request again.

Things to add:

- Higher quality maps
- Switch between normal and hard campaign maps
- Add the rest of the campaign chapters
